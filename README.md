# Thesis_on_ICT_in_Crop_Industry

Abstract:

The South African economy relies on the agricultural sector to produce food, export
goods, and employ a large portion of its population. The South African crop planting
industry is faced with a problem of increases emanating from input costs which change
yearly. Information Communication Technology (ICT) and digitalization are new
concepts in the farming industry. Studies have shown that these two concepts can have
an influence on the industry by reducing input costs and improving efficiency. The goals
of this interpretivist research project aim to add to the field of knowledge concerning
ICT and digitalization in the crop planting industry. Additionally, it identifies any factors
that may discourage farmers from investing into the new digital era.

This study posed the following research questions:

▪ How does digitalization improve decision-making for planting crops?

▪ What are the limiting factors to adopting the digital era?

To achieve the project goals, the design of the study adopted a mixed method strategy.
The target population was farmers in the crop planting industry. The sample population
was farmers from the Tulbagh and Malmesbury region in the Western Cape. The
methodology comprised of data collection techniques included a case study and semistructured interviews where content analysis was used to analyse the data. To handle
ethical dilemmas, the researcher needed to adopt a professional code of conduct and
ensure participants experienced no harm in any form during the project. The results of
this research project included a framework of guidelines that; inform farmers of the best
practices for crop planting and identify the limiting factors preventing farmers from
adopting the digital era. This research project comprised of four limitations: lack of a
budget, short completion period, potential language barrier with participants and
availability of participants. Future research could explore this concept in other rural
areas of South Africa.
